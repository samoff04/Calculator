## Description

This project is a beautifully designed, fully functional calculator created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features a modern, animated user interface with smooth button interactions, providing a delightful user experience.

Key highlights:

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Includes functionality for clear (`C`), delete (`âŒ«`), decimal point, and equals (`=`).
- A distinct **Leave** button that prompts a beautifully animated confirmation popup.
- Upon confirming the leave action, the calculator disables all input and displays a friendly goodbye popup.
- Responsive layout with vibrant gradients and intuitive animations.
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

This project is excellent for beginners to intermediate developers to learn JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and modular coding practices.
